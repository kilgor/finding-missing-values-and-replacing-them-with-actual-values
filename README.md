after facing many missing values in different dataframes I tried to create a class that can find and replace these missing values with calculated values in linear regression models.
I hope can some one test it with different datasets and help me to develop it fuhrer more. I got help from various AI's

first you need to initialize needed libraries numpy, pandas linear regression

identify path of data 
after identifying put y and x values in data
clear the data for inspection just dont touch missing values lines, on the contrary change all the data in to numerical values and start the class.

in my code I put an example dataframe housing.csv and I worked on it.

if you like it just thumbs up please (:
if you want to use it, it is free completely (:
